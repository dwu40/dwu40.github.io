      <h1>About:</h1>
      <p>
        I am Danny Wu, a second term student of the Computer Programming & Analysis program at
        Seneca College. This project was created to make use of basic HTML5 taught in the WEB222 -
        Web Programming Principles course. I chose the topic of Women Astronauts to promote the
        history and achievement of women in space exploration.
